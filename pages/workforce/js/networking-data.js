    one member of the department or another awake at any time of the day.
    Finding snippets of code through infinite hours of scrolling, clear out
    something thats "bugging" you, or helping the other OGs with all the
    problems in their computers. All these fall right under their domain.`,

    conclave does justice to it every year with their list of speakers that

    and creates and bonds over hunching over their laptops for hours making
    countless revisions to their work. Last minute changes and digital art are
    their priorities. They perpetually run on all-nighters and sticker
    collections.`,

    multi-linguists. They truly understand the aesthetics of Malhar and
    carefully put it on a platter for the world to watch. If you see the
    booming Instagram stats, you know that the PR masterminds are proud of

    of individuals who want to have fun while seeming like experts by using
    terms like ISO, Aperture, Shutter Speed, etc. Trust us, we do. Copyrights
    adore us a little too much, and we wish we could return the favor.`,
